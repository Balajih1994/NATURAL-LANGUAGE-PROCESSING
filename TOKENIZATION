para = 'The Supreme Court heard its last arguments of the term a week ago and has entered a quiet period. 
It issued a single decision on Monday, in a case on religion. 
The justices are not scheduled to meet together in private until May 12. 
The next scheduled day on which decisions may be issued is May 16, although the court can certainly add additional days. 
Its practice in argued cases is to announce ahead of time that decisions will be issued on a given day without specifying which ones.  
There are about 37 decisions and two months left.'
